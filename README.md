<h1 align="left">Vehicle Alert App</h1>

  My first application created as part of learning and practicing. The idea for the app was created due to my own needs. As an owner of several vehicles, I have always had problems with performing service on time. The app is a mini version of an app for taking care of a fleet of vehicles.
